Outline of Key Concepts in C++ Notes:

I. Object-Oriented Design and Class Properties
   A. Default Constructors
      1. Automatically created if not defined
      2. Takes no parameters
      3. Initializes attributes to default values
   B. Multiple Constructors (Overloading)
      1. More than one constructor for a class
      2. Used to customize object initialization
      3. Vary the number or type of parameters
   C. Constructor Chaining
      1. One constructor calls another
      2. Can be chained multiple times
   D. Control of Properties
      1. Getters (Accessors)
         a. Public methods to access private attributes
      2. Setters (Modifiers)
         a. Public methods to modify private attributes
         b. Can include protections to prevent bad data

II. Visibility of Class Content
   A. Public: accessible from anywhere outside the class
   B. Private: only accessible within the class
   C. General Rules
      1. Attributes are typically private
      2. Methods are often public

III. Accessors and Modifiers
   A. Enable controlled access to private attributes
   B. Prevent direct manipulation of attributes

IV. Using 'this' and 'self'
   A. Resolve ambiguity between class attributes and method parameters

V. Constructor Chaining in C++
   A. Old way: use an initialization method
   B. New way (C++11 onwards): use the new syntax

VI. Summary
   A. Classes consist of variables and methods
   B. Variables should be private; methods should be public or private based on intended use
   C. Encapsulation is promoted through controlled access to variables
